                    <p>During my internship at Ford I served as an undergraduate intern under the 
                        ADAS ML and MLOps teams.<br><br> My main responsiblities involved developing frameworks
                        to assist with the training and evaluation of PII-Masking Models. These models leveraged
                        computer vision to apply a blur to faces and license plates in videos. I then prepared my
                        frameworks for internal use on the HPC environment via Ray and Docker. The 
                        tools/libraries I used involved Python, OpenCV, FFMPEG and TensorFlow.</p>

                    <small>Sep. 2023 - Mar. 2024</small>
                    <p>In my 3rd year as an undergraduate at UCI, I joined Professor Brian Demsky's research group. <br><br>
                        During the first quarter, we were tasked with exploring the capabilities of GPT-4 in helping
                        software engineers with various tasks such as debugging and end-to-end development. I was also
                        involved in stress testing a framework he developed, which created two separate GPT-4 sessions
                        to perform a software development task like developing a web application. One would act as a
                        teacher/senior developer to coach, and the other would be the student/junior developer to write
                        the code. <br><br> During my second quarter, I developed a script using this framework to allow the
                        lldb debugger to directly communicate with GPT-4 using the OpenAI python library and function call API. 
                        The advantage of this script being that a developer wouldn't need extensive knowledge of lldb to identify
                        bugs in an automated fashion.
